Inspired by our FiveM Discord Server (https://discord.gg/fqvJJP4Uvk) not being quick to do things a bot could do instantly. I decided to make a bot that could do these things. This bot is still in development and will be updated frequently. 
If you have any suggestions, please feel free to make a pull request or open an issue.
